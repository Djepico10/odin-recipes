# odin-recipes
Beginning of Project:
In this project, I will be building a basic recipe page using basic HTML syntax that I have learned. At the end, I will have a better grasp on how to better use HTML to form a skeleton for my future webpages. I will also learn to improve my link building skills.

Completion of Project:
During this project I learned how to better use HTML to form the skeleton of a webpage. I was able to improve my link building skills. I also tried to make the webpage as pretty as possible with the few tools I had to work with. I am happy I was able to complete this project while adding a little extra to it to help me practice HTML more.
