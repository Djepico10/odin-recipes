    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A calzone is an Italian oven-baked folded pizza, often described as a turnover, made with leavened dough. This is real calzone, because there is no tomato sauce INSIDE of it!</p>

    <h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25oz) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><u>Directions</u></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To Make Dough: In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add the oil, sugar and salt; mix in 1 cup of the flour until smooth. Gradually stir in the rest of the flour, until dough is smooth and workable. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, or until it is elastic. Lay dough in a bowl containing 1 teaspoon olive oil, then flip the dough, cover and let rise for 40 minutes, or until almost doubled.</li>
        <li>To Make Filling: While dough is rising, combine the ricotta cheese, Cheddar cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms and basil leaves in a large bowl. Mix well, cover bowl and refrigerate to chill.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>When dough is ready, punch it down and separate it into 2 equal parts. Roll parts out into thin circles on a lightly floured surface. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese/meat filling and fold over, securing edges by folding in and pressing with a fork. Brush the top of each calzone with egg and place on a lightly greased cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
